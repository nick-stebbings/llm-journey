# Project Summary

Welcome to my playground of possibilities! I'm diving headfirst into the world of generative AI, armed with the latest tools and a bucketful of curiosity. My mission? To see what I can build in the distributed web/machine learning spaces. It's a bit like constructing a sandcastle with a blindfold on - I'm not entirely sure what I'll end up with, but I'm certain it's going to be fun!

# Projects in the Pipeline

Here's a sneak peek at some of the projects I'm planning to tackle:

- Creating a simple game that allows you to tip cryptocurrency. Think of it as a digital wishing well, but instead of tossing in coins, you're tossing in crypto!
- Creating a Nostr relay. I'm still working out the details on this one, but rest assured, it's going to be nostr-ly impressive!

And that's just the beginning. I've got a whole list of projects up my sleeves, so stay tuned for more exciting updates!

# Get In Touch

If you have an idea of something you would like to see me make with LLMs and AI language assistants, use the Contact form, linked from the menu.

# Prompt for this page

All the above content was created with an LLM, and then tweaked a little. The prompt I used was:

```
Edit project-summary.md so that it gives a summary of the project. Act as a 
world class copyrighter. Use a playful tone. Leave a gap for examples of some 
of the projects to be completed, but start the list with these: "create a simp
le game that allows you to tip cryptocurrency", "create a nostr relay".
```
