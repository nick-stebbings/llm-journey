# Project Summary

Welcome to our playground of possibilities! I'm diving headfirst into the world of generative AI, armed with the latest tools and a bucketful of curiosity. Our mission? To see what I can build in the distributed web/machine learning spaces. It's a bit like constructing a sandcastle with a blindfold on - I'm not entirely sure what I'll end up with, but I'm certain it's going to be fun!

# Projects in the Pipeline

Here's a sneak peek at some of the projects I'm planning to tackle:

- Creating a simple game that allows you to tip cryptocurrency. Think of it as a digital wishing well, but instead of tossing in coins, you're tossing in crypto!
- Creating a Nostr relay. I'm still working out the details on this one, but rest assured, it's going to be nostr-ly impressive!

And that's just the beginning. We've got a whole list of projects up our sleeves, so stay tuned for more exciting updates!
